Chapter of Devas
================

 

Devatā Saṃyutta

 

The Devatā Saṃyutta is the first book in the Saṃyutta Nikāya and so must
be considered as a one of the most significant chapters. It describes
the brief conversations between the Buddha and heavenly devās. Devās are
heavenly beings of great splendour and power. They were human beings in
the past and rose to the heavens because of their selfless good acts or
their meditation realizations.

Cross the flood. Ogha taraṇa suttaṃ.

 

<span class="c1">A Deva, long lived and clothed in light itself visited
Lord Buddha. The Deva asked, </span><span class="c1 c3">does Sir know
how to cross this flood?</span><span class="c1"> </span>

<span class="c1">Kathaṃ nu tvaṃ, mārisa, ogham atari?  
Lord Buddha replied, By n</span><span class="c1 c3">ot standing (on the
bottom), by not reaching out, is the flood crossed</span><span
class="c1">.</span>

<span class="c1">Appatiṭṭhaṃ khvāhaṃ
anāyūhaṃ</span><a href="#footnotes.xhtml#footnote1" id="chapter-1.xhtml#footnote-ref1"><bdi><span class="c1 c4"><sup>1</sup></span></bdi></a><span
class="c1"> ogham atari.</span>

 

This made no sense, not even to a god in heaven. Perhaps the answer is
meant to be seen directly. The god or deva asked “But what do you mean?”

 

<span class="c1">Surrounded by rushing water, </span><span
class="c1 c3">when I stood on the bottom, then I sank. When I reached
out swimming, then I was carried
away</span><a href="#footnotes.xhtml#footnote2" id="chapter-1.xhtml#footnote-ref2"><bdi><span class="c1 c5"><sup>2</sup></span></bdi></a><span
class="c1 c3">.  
</span><span class="c1">Yadā khvāhaṃ santiṭṭhāmi tadāssu saṃsīdāmi. Yadā
khvāhaṃ āyūhāmi tadāssu nibbuyhāmi.</span>

 

The deva then understood. Why would the deva understand after Lord
Buddha gave these extra hints? (If we only could speak to that deva! He
or she is probably still there in that heavenly world!)

 

<span class="c1">When eyes are closed and attention is inward, thoughts
arise like rising flood waters. Some thoughts are caused from an
experience such as a sound just heard, or a bodily feeling just felt.
These thoughts are a liking or a disliking to what just happened. After
all, it just happened to you, to a ‘you’, so it seems. And this ‘you’ is
a ground and support for all the thoughts. </span><span
class="c1 c3">Yadā khvāhaṃ santiṭṭhāmi tadāssu saṃsīdāmi.</span><span
class="c1"> In the deep water, I stood on the submerged ground, and I
sank. </span>

 

Imagine this support, this cause, no longer there. Imagine what happens
when consciousness has no support: no concept nor experience.

 

When eyes are closed and attention is inward, thoughts arise like rising
flood waters. Some thoughts are about what will I be, what will I feel,
what will I see. Something in the future. Some thoughts are memories of
what I was, what I felt, what I saw. Something in the past, wanted,
unwanted.

 

<span class="c1">These thoughts are a reaching out, a hard swimming to a
being something, to a feeling something. In the rushing flood, we are
carried away. </span><span class="c1 c3">Yadā khvāhaṃ āyūhāmi tadāssu
nibbuyhāmi.</span><span class="c1"> When I reached out swimming, then I
was carried away.</span>

 

Imagine not looking forward, not looking back. Imaging not looking, not
searching, not reaching out.

 

The deva imagined. And said

<span class="c1 c6">After a long time I see</span><span class="c1">
</span><span class="c1 c7">Cirassaṃ vata passāmi, </span>

<span class="c1 c6">a brahmin extinguished. </span><span
class="c1 c7">brāhmaṇaṃ parinibbutaṃ; </span>

<span class="c1 c6">Neither standing nor swimming, </span><span
class="c1 c7">Appatiṭṭhaṃ anāyūhaṃ, </span>

<span class="c1 c6">overcome clinging to the world. </span><span
class="c1 c7">tiṇṇaṃ loke visattikan ti.</span><span class="c1"> </span>
