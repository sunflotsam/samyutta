[Devatā Saṃyutta]{.c1 .c2}

Chapter of Devas {.p2 style=""}
================

 

Devatā Saṃyutta

 

The Devatā Saṃyutta is the first book in the Saṃyutta Nikāya and so must
be considered as a one of the most significant chapters. It describes
the brief conversations between the Buddha and heavenly devās. Devās are
heavenly beings of great splendour and power. They were human beings in
the past and rose to the heavens because of their selfless good acts or
their meditation realizations.

Cross the flood. Ogha taraṇa suttaṃ.

 

[A Deva, long lived and clothed in light itself visited Lord Buddha. The
Deva asked, ]{.c1}[does Sir know how to cross this flood?]{.c1 .c3}[
]{.c1}

[Kathaṃ nu tvaṃ, mārisa, ogham atari?\
Lord Buddha replied, By n]{.c1}[ot standing (on the bottom), by not
reaching out, is the flood crossed]{.c1 .c3}[.]{.c1}

[Appatiṭṭhaṃ khvāhaṃ anāyūhaṃ]{.c1}[`<bdi>`{=html}[^1^]{.c1
.c4}`</bdi>`{=html}](#footnotes.xhtml#footnote1){#chapter-1.xhtml#footnote-ref1}[
ogham atari.]{.c1}

 

This made no sense, not even to a god in heaven. Perhaps the answer is
meant to be seen directly. The god or deva asked "But what do you mean?"

 

[Surrounded by rushing water, ]{.c1}[when I stood on the bottom, then I
sank. When I reached out swimming, then I was carried away]{.c1
.c3}[`<bdi>`{=html}[^2^]{.c1
.c5}`</bdi>`{=html}](#footnotes.xhtml#footnote2){#chapter-1.xhtml#footnote-ref2}[.\
]{.c1 .c3}[Yadā khvāhaṃ santiṭṭhāmi tadāssu saṃsīdāmi. Yadā khvāhaṃ
āyūhāmi tadāssu nibbuyhāmi.]{.c1}

 

The deva then understood. Why would the deva understand after Lord
Buddha gave these extra hints? (If we only could speak to that deva! He
or she is probably still there in that heavenly world!)

 

[When eyes are closed and attention is inward, thoughts arise like
rising flood waters. Some thoughts are caused from an experience such as
a sound just heard, or a bodily feeling just felt. These thoughts are a
liking or a disliking to what just happened. After all, it just happened
to you, to a 'you', so it seems. And this 'you' is a ground and support
for all the thoughts. ]{.c1}[Yadā khvāhaṃ santiṭṭhāmi tadāssu
saṃsīdāmi.]{.c1 .c3}[ In the deep water, I stood on the submerged
ground, and I sank. ]{.c1}

 

Imagine this support, this cause, no longer there. Imagine what happens
when consciousness has no support: no concept nor experience.

 

When eyes are closed and attention is inward, thoughts arise like rising
flood waters. Some thoughts are about what will I be, what will I feel,
what will I see. Something in the future. Some thoughts are memories of
what I was, what I felt, what I saw. Something in the past, wanted,
unwanted.

 

[These thoughts are a reaching out, a hard swimming to a being
something, to a feeling something. In the rushing flood, we are carried
away. ]{.c1}[Yadā khvāhaṃ āyūhāmi tadāssu nibbuyhāmi.]{.c1 .c3}[ When I
reached out swimming, then I was carried away.]{.c1}

 

Imagine not looking forward, not looking back. Imaging not looking, not
searching, not reaching out.

 

The deva imagined. And said

[After a long time I see]{.c1 .c6}[ ]{.c1}[Cirassaṃ vata passāmi, ]{.c1
.c7}

[a brahmin extinguished. ]{.c1 .c6}[brāhmaṇaṃ parinibbutaṃ; ]{.c1 .c7}

[Neither standing nor swimming, ]{.c1 .c6}[Appatiṭṭhaṃ anāyūhaṃ, ]{.c1
.c7}

[overcome clinging to the world. ]{.c1 .c6}[tiṇṇaṃ loke visattikan
ti.]{.c1 .c7}[ ]{.c1}
