##Liberation<br>*Nimokkhasutta*
(From the works of Bhikkhu Sujāto [Sutta Central](https://suttacentral.net))

A Deva, long lived and clothed in light itself visited Lord Buddha. The Deva asked, 
> Sir, Do you understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion?” 
<br>_Jānāsi no tvaṃ, mārisa, sattānaṃ nimokkhaṃ pamokkhaṃ vivekanti_
