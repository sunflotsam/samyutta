##Liberation<br>*Nimokkhasutta*
(From the works of Bhikkhu Sujāto [Sutta Central](https://suttacentral.net))

A Deva, long lived and clothed in light itself visited Lord Buddha. The Deva asked, 
> Sir, Do you understand liberation, emancipation, and seclusion?” 
<br>_Jānāsi no tvaṃ, mārisa, sattānaṃ nimokkhaṃ pamokkhaṃ vivekanti_


Lord Buddha replied,
> Yes, I do.  
With the ending of relish for rebirth,  
the finishing of perception and consciousness,  
and the cessation and stilling of feelings:  
that, sir, is how I understand liberation,  
emancipation, and seclusion for sentient beings.  
_Nandībhavaparikkhayā,_
_Saññāviññāṇasaṅkhayā;
Vedanānaṃ nirodhā upasamā,
Evaṃ khvāhaṃ āvuso jānāmi;
Sattānaṃ nimokkhaṃ pamokkhaṃ vivekanti_
