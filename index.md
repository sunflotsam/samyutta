# Notes on * Samutta Nikaya *

## Chapter of Gods<br>*Devatā Saṃyutta*

The Devatā Saṃyutta is the first book in the Saṃyutta Nikāya and so must be considered as a one of the most significant chapters. It describes the brief conversations between Lord Buddha and heavenly devās. Devās are heavenly beings of great splendour and power and could be thought of as gods. They were human beings in the past and rose to the heavens because of their selfless good acts or their meditation realizations.
