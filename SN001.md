Devatā Saṃyutta
Chapter of Devas

# Chapter of Gods<br>*Devatā Saṃyutta*

The Devatā Saṃyutta is the first book in the Saṃyutta Nikāya and so must be considered as a one of the most significant chapters. It describes the brief conversations between Lord Buddha and heavenly devās. Devās are heavenly beings of great splendour and power and could be thought of as gods. They were human beings in the past and rose to the heavens because of their selfless good acts or their meditation realizations.

## Cross the flood.<br>*Ogha taraṇa suttaṃ.*

A Deva, long lived and clothed in light itself visited Lord Buddha. The Deva asked, 
> Does Sir know how to cross this flood?
<br>*Kathaṃ nu tvaṃ, mārisa, ogham atari?*
 

Lord Buddha replied,
> By not standing (on the bottom),  by not reaching out, is the flood crossed.
<br>*Appatiṭṭhaṃ khvāhaṃ anāyūhaṃ[^1] ogham atari.*
 
 [^1]: *ayuham* is often translated as striving, but I use *Āyūhati sabbagattebhi jantu* meaining they reach out with every limb.  (*Dāmalisutta*)

This made no sense, not even to a god in heaven. Perhaps the answer is meant to be seen directly. The Deva asked
> But what do you mean, Sir?
<br>*Yathākathaṃ pana tvaṃ, mārisa, appatiṭṭhaṃ anāyūhaṃ oghamatarīti*


> Surrounded by rushing water, when I stood on the bottom, then I sank.
<br>When I reached out swimming, then I was carried away. 
<br>*Yadā khvāhaṃ santiṭṭhāmi tadāssu saṃsīdāmi.*
<br>*Yadā khvāhaṃ āyūhāmi tadāssu nibbuyhāmi[^nibbuyhāmi].*

[^nibbuyhāmi]: like a corpse to the cemetery: _Nibbuyhati susānaṃ_

The deva then understood. Why would the deva understand after Lord Buddha added so little?

When eyes are closed and attention is inward, thoughts arise like rising flood waters. Some thoughts are caused from an experience such as a sound just heard, or a bodily feeling just felt.  These thoughts are a liking or a disliking to what just happened. After all, it just happened to you, to a ‘you’, so it seems. And this ‘you’ is a ground and support for all the thoughts. _Yadā khvāhaṃ santiṭṭhāmi tadāssu saṃsīdāmi._ In the deep water, I tried to stand the bottom below, and I sank. 

Imagine this support, this cause, no longer there. Imagine what happens when consciousness has no support: no concept nor experience to stand on?

When eyes are closed and attention is inward, thoughts arise like rising flood waters. Some thoughts are about what will I be, what will I feel, what will I see. Something in the future. Some thoughts are memories of what I was, what I felt, what I saw. Something in the past, wanted, unwanted.

These thoughts are a reaching out, a hard swimming to a being something, to a feeling something. In the rushing flood, we are carried away. Yadā khvāhaṃ āyūhāmi tadāssu nibbuyhāmi. When I reached out swimming, then I was carried away.

Imagine not looking forward, not looking back. Imaging not looking, not searching, not reaching out.

The deva imagined. And said
>After a long time I see  
a brahmin extinguished.  
Neither standing nor swimming,  
overcome clinging to the world.    
*Cirassaṃ vata passāmi,*  
*brāhmaṇaṃ parinibbutaṃ;*  
*Appatiṭṭhaṃ anāyūhaṃ,*  
*Tiṇṇaṃ loke visattikan ti.*
